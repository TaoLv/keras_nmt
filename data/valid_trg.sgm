<seg id=1> African National Congress Opposes Sanctions against Zimbabwe </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, Johannesburg, March 18 (Reporter Gao Yuan) Motlanthe, secretary general of African National Congress (ANC), the ruling party of South Africa, criticized here on the 18th the Western nations such as the United States and Britain for their attempt of using sanctions to force Zimbabwe into following the will of the Western nations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> In response to the Western nations' threat of imposing sanctions against Zimbabwe, Motlanthe told the press: "Who should rule Zimbabwe is Zimbabwians' own business and should not be decided by the Western nations." </seg>
<seg id=4> He pointed out, mutual respect of sovereignty is an international norm that each nation should abide by; and ANC strongly opposes the Western nations' sanction against a sovereign nation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> If the Western nations impose further sanctions against Zimbabwe, Motlanthe said, they will fail to improve the situation and will instead worsen the social turmoil in Zimbabwe. </seg>
<seg id=6> He called on the government of Zimbabwe to cooperate with the opposition parties to jointly overcome the difficulties they face such as food shortage and land crisis. </seg>
<seg id=7> He emphasized that only by getting firmly united can they foil any attempt to split Zimbabwe. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> Earlier, ANC had made a statement asking the international community to respect the choice of Zimbabwians and help them survive the hard time. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> Mugabe, president of Zimbabwe, was re-elected during the presidential election from March 9 to March 11. However, the Western nations claim that the election was marred by serious frauds and that it lacked fairness and freedom. They therefore refused to accept the result of the election and threatened to impose further sanctions against Zimbabwe. </seg>
<seg id=10> At present, some Western nations have already announced their termination of economic aid to Zimbabwe. </seg>
<seg id=11> Before the election, EU nations cited Zimbabwe government's restriction of freedom of the press and obstruction of supervision as an excuse and had already enforced "targeted" sanctions against Zimbabwe. </seg>

<seg id=1> Jordan to Come Back from his Recovery of Injury as Early as Sunday </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency, Washington, March 19 (Reporter Xie Peiling) "Air Jordan" is expected to come back as early as Sunday from his recovery of injury after the right-knee surgery. However, as the regular season is approaching its end, it seems hard for Washington Wizards to impact the after season games as a result of this.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> The Wizards Coach Collins revealed today that Jordan has currently intensified his rehabilitation warming-up. Although he does not yet want to show up in Denver and Salt Lake City on Wednesday and Thursday, he is very likely to go to Toronto to re-don his Wizards outfit and challenge the Raptors that is currently not in a good shape. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> Collins said: "He may show up at any time; it all depends on how he feels. </seg>
<seg id=5> Currently his training is focused on the defensive as well as practicing shooting at the basket. </seg>
<seg id=6> He plans to increase the intensity a little bit, just to check if his body can make the adjustment. </seg>
<seg id=7> As far as his knee is concerned, he said he felt at least one hundred percent better than before the surgery." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> Jordan has averaged a score of 24.3 during this season. He underwent the surgery three weeks ago. In the meantime, his team won 4 games and lost 8.  </seg>
<seg id=9> At present, there are only 15 games left for the regular season. The Wizards has won 31 and lost 36, ranking 10th in the NBA Eastern Conference. It lagged half a game behind the Miami Heat, one game in advance of the Raptors, but is still two and half games away from Charlotte Hornets that ranked 8th. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> Naturally, Coach Collins in particular hopes Jordan's comeback will enhance the team qualitatively, enabling it at least to win successively within a short period of time and thus rekindling a glimmer of hope for the after season games. </seg>
<seg id=11> Collins said: "If Jordan hadn't been absent because of his injury, we would have won at least three more games at an earlier time. </seg>
<seg id=12> Judging from the current situation, he certainly should be able to jump start the team." </seg>

<seg id=2> Karzai told the reporters at the airport after his two-day visit in Turkey that Afghans outside the capital of Kabul all consider the extension of the peace-keeping troops' activities as an assurance of the continued security in Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id=3> Earlier this year, Karzai requested that the UN extend the mission area of the peace-keeping troops and station them in areas outside the capital of Kabul. </seg>
<seg id=4> Such an action, he said, would send out a signal that the international community assumes its obligations toward a country ravaged by war for 23 years. </seg>
<seg id=5> Turkey has agreed on principle to take over from Britain the command of the peace-keeping troops in Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id=6> However, concerned about the safety in areas outside Kabul, Turkey did not agree to extend the mission area of the peace-keeping troops. </seg>
<seg id=7> The United States has made it clear that it supports Turkey's position. </seg>
<seg id=8> Karzai said on the 5th that Turkey's concern over its troops' potential involvement in renewed unrest in other areas of Afghanistan is redundant. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=2> (Beijing, AFP) The state media of China said that yesterday a serious sandstorm hit Beijing again. </seg>
<seg id=3> Although the government has invested huge sums of money to improve the environment in Beijing and prevent the sandstorm from approaching Beijing, eliminating the sandstorms that occur frequently every year remains the major difficulty facing the City of Beijing where Olympics Games is to be held in 2008. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> China National Meteorological Bureau forecasts said that the first sandstorm of this year hit Beijing last Friday. The cold fronts from Mongolia are expected to envelop Beijing in a yellow dusty haze. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> Yang Weixi (transliterated), chief engineer of the Desertification Control Center of China's Ministry of Forestry told Beijing Review: "I can't say there will be no more sandstorms in 2008. </seg>
<seg id=6> What we can do is to control the human factors that cause sandstorms and prevent desertification of the environment." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> He said, however, natural factors beyond human control such as wind, drought, and vast deserts make it impossible for China to avoid sandstorms within a short period of time. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> The Chinese government pledged to pour in 56.8 billion yuan (12.376 billion Singapore dollars) from 2002 to 2008 to curb desertification and reduce the formation of sandstorms. </seg>
<seg id=9> Beijing alone will spend about 1 billion yuan (about 220 million Singapore dollars) this year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> An expert from China Forestry Research Institute said: "Increased financial appropriations will greatly improve the situation, but...it may take decades to see the result of harnessing efforts." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=11> Chinese environmental experts warned after conducting a survey at the beginning of this year: About one third of the land in China is currently desert. It is mainly caused by human beings' economic activities such overgrazing. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=12> The survey report said that in the first six months of last year, 18 sandstorms struck Beijing, and they all originated from Inner Mongolia where 60% of the land is desert. </seg>

Therefore, their clients are mostly the government agencies, corporations and institutions. The ratio of the fake certificates among some of these clients is very high.

<p>
<seg id=6> Approved by the relevant agency of the Chinese Ministry of Education, the College Graduates Placement Center of Guangdong Province is currently the only authorized agency in China to verify diplomas and credentials of higher education in the country. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> (Taipei) A year and half have passed since the plane crash of the Singapore Airlines, yet Aviation Safety Council of Taiwan (ASC) has delayed the investigation report on the plane crash again and again, stalling the investigation by Taoyuan district prosecutor's office and causing the prosecutors to smell a rat. As for ASC, it has promised to deliver the investigation report in April. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> At 11:18 p.m. on October 31, 2000, the Singapore Airlines Flight SQ-006 at Chiang Kai-shek Airport bound for Los Angeles entered by error the runway #05 on the right side during take-off and crashed into the two digging machines and exploded, killing 83 passengers and injuring nearly a hundred passengers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> China Times reported yesterday that Taoyuan district prosecutor's office in charge of prosecuting for criminal liability after the plane crash has had several disputes over the right to investigate with ASC investigation unit. </seg>
<seg id=5> Since the plane crash, Wang Tiensheng, former chief prosecutor of Taoyuan prosecutor's office, has been promoted to chief prosecutor of Taichong. Chen Shouhuang serves as his replacement. The case prosecutor Huang Moushin has also been transferred to Taipei prosecutor's office, handing over the case to Chiang Yuanchen. </seg>
<seg id=6> Meanwhile, the original due date of the investigation report at the end of last year promised by ASC was postponed to the end of January. After the end of January, it was again changed to February. So far there has been no news. Urged by the prosecutors, ASC now promises to deliver the report in April. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> As Los Angeles was the destination of Flight SQ-006, some of the victims' families have already taken the case to the US court for huge sums of civil compensation, suing not only Singapore Airlines but also Taiwan Civil Aviation Administration. </seg>
<seg id=8> The lawsuit by the victims' families for compensation is tantamount to accusing Taiwan Aviation Administration's Control Tower of negligence of duty. Therefore, the result of the investigation by Taoyuan prosecutor's office will draw all the more attention. </seg>

<seg id=1> Chinese American Engineer Sentenced to 5-year Imprisonment for Illegally Obtaining China's State Secrets and Bribery </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> (Beijing, AP) Beijing No.1 Intermediate People's Court yesterday sentenced the Chinese American engineer Fang Fuming to 5 years in prison on charges of illegally obtaining state secrets and bribing on behalf of a company. </seg>
<seg id=3> The case had aroused protests from the United States. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> The spokesman for the US embassy in China said that Fang Fuming will be deported from China after he serves his time. </seg>
<seg id=5> The time of his sentence will be adjusted according to the time he has already served. </seg>
<seg id=6> The US embassy had sent a diplomat to attend the hearing. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> The attorney representing Fang Fuming said that his client has already been imprisoned for two years, but China said it was not that long. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> Xinhua News Agency confirmed the ruling. </seg>
<seg id=9> It said, from 1995 to 1999, Fang Fuming obtained 35 documents containing state secrets and gave 245,000 US dollars (about 450,000 Singapore dollars in current value) in bribes to state workers to assist foreign investors bidding for China's power construction projects.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> Fang Fuming was an electrical engineering consultant for a foreign company in its China and other Asian offices. </seg>
<seg id=11> Cohen, the attorney representing Fang Fuming, said that Fang Fuming denied giving bribes and said he was a victim to the embezzling Chinese officials in the power industry. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=12> Once a Chinese official in the power industry, Fang Fuming became a US citizen in 1994. </seg>
<seg id=13> In the past two years, a number of US citizens and residents were accused of violating the Chinese national security laws. Fang Fuming was one of them. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=14> The arrest of Fang Fuming had temporarily caused tensions between China and the United States. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=15> The US government repeatedly protested against the way China handled the case of Fang Fuming, accusing the Chinese authorities of violating the international norms by detaining Fang Fuming for several months without any trial. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=16> The family members of Fang Fuming said he was badly treated. </seg>
<seg id=17> His wife and two children are all US citizens. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=18> Cohen said, Fang Fuming was detained on February 28, 2000, but the date of custody set by the Chinese Foreign Ministry is August 28, 2000. </seg>

<seg id=1> China Called off Naval Fleet's Visit to the US, Declined to Confirm Whether Hu Jintao Will Visit US as Planned  </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> (Beijing, Syndicated news) The Sino-US relation that was heated momentarily by the US President Bush's visit to China is cooling down rapidly. China confirmed yesterday that it has called off its naval fleet visit to the US ports this year and refused to confirm whether the country's Vice President Hu Jintao will visit the United States as planned. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> The Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue said while answering reporters' questions at a routine press conference: "As far as I know, China's naval fleet is preparing for a visit as planned; its itinerary does not include the US ports." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> When a reporter asked her twice whether Hu Jintao's plan to visit the United States is affected and whether she can clarify that an earlier answer can be interpreted as an indication that Hu Jintao will visit the US in April as scheduled, Zhang Qiyue would not make any further comments nor would she confirm anything. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> Zhang Qiyue only repeatedly accused the US of "doing a series of things that violate the three joint communiques between China and the US" within a short period of one month after President Bush's visit to China and demanded that the US "stop using the issue of Taiwan to interfere in China's internal affairs." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> On the other hand, in Washington D.C., the US ignored on Wednesday China's warning that a "chilly wind" is blowing over the Sino-US relations and insisted that there is nothing wrong with the US permission of Taiwan's defense minister to attend "US-Taiwan Defense Summit" held in Florida. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Beijing repeatedly attacked the US for issuing a visa to Taiwan's Defense Minister Tang Yiau-ming earlier this month and allowing him to attend a conference sponsored by the US arms manufacturers. </seg>
<seg id=8> Tang Yiau-ming also met with two senior US officials at the time. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> At a routine press conference, State Department spokesman Boucher was hounded by reporters asking about China's complaints over this issue, but obviously he was trying his best to avoid a battle of words with China. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> He said: "After this meeting, our position is well-known to all. </seg>
<seg id=11> If you want to ask me about this every day, I am willing to explain it every day. If China wants to ask about this every day, we are willing to explain it every day." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=12> He said: "The position hasn't changed. These are our normal contacts with the Taiwanese. We will continue to do so." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=13> Zhang Qiyue also confirmed yesterday the Russian media's report, saying that the Chinese President Jiang Zemin called the Russian President Putin by phone at his request the night before, and both sides exchanged their opinions on cooperations between China and Russia based on mutual benefits. </seg>
<seg id=14> Both sides believe it is in the interest of both nations and peoples to develop mutually beneficial cooperations between China and Russia. </seg>

<seg id=2> Agence France Presse, Beijing -- According to Chinese State Media, Beijing had another serious sandstorm yesterday. </seg>
<seg id=3> Despite costly environmental efforts to halt the advance of the desert to Beijing, sandstorms continue their frequent annual assault on the capital city. Sandstorms look like to remain a serious challenge to Beijing, which is going to host the 2008 Olympics. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> According to China Meteorological Administration's forecasts, the year's first sandstorm struck Beijing last Friday with further windy cold fronts from the Mongolian steppe expected to shroud Beijing in a yellow, dusty haze.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> "I cannot say sandstorms won't occur in 2008," Yang Weixi (transliteration), chief engineer of the Desertification Control Center of China's Ministry of Forestry told the Beijing Weekend publication.  </seg>
<seg id=6> "What we can do is to manage the man-made factors which cause sandstorms and the expansion of desertification," he said.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> However, conditions beyond human control, like wind, drought and huge existing deserts, would make it impossible to get rid of the storms in a short time frame, Yang said.  </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> The Chinese government has committed to spend Renminbi 56.8 billion (about Singapore Dollars 12.376 billion) to curb desertification and lessen sandstorms between 2002 and 2008. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=11> Chinese environmentalists raised alarm bells after a survey earlier this year, which found almost a third of the country's land mass is now desert largely due to human economic activity, such as livestock overgrazing.  </seg>

<seg id=1> Singapore Airlines' crash in Taiwan: Aviation Safety Council has delayed its report; prosecutor's office is asking why </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Taipei news -- The Singapore Airlines crash had happened for more than one and half years. However, Taiwan's Aviation Safety Council (SAC) has delayed the release of its final report several times, which has effectively made the investigation by Taoyuan prosecutor's office to a standstill. The prosecutor's office is challenging the rationale and SAC has now undertaken to release a report before end of April. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> On October 31, 2000 at 11:18 PM, Singapore Airlines' SQ-006 attempted to take off from Chiang Kai Shek International Airport for Los Angeles. In the course of the take off, the plane entered 05-right runway. The plane then hit two dredgers that were on the runway. The impact caused an explosion and the death of 83 passengers. More than 100 passengers were injured in the accident. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> "China Times" reported yesterday: The Taoyuan prosecutor's office has been investigating for possible criminal liabilities in parallel to a probe into the cause of the crash by SAC. Unfortunately, the two have several disputes over investigation rights. </seg>
<seg id=5> From the date of the crash till now, Taoyuan district court chief prosecutor Wang Teng-sheng in charge of the case was promoted chief prosecutor for Taichung. Chen Sou-huang filled his position. The case was then taken over by prosecutor Huang Mo-hsin but he was also transferred to Taipei later. The case is currently the responsibility of Chiang Yuan-chen. </seg>
<seg id=6> SAC originally says that they can complete the investigation by the end of last year. SAC subsequently delayed the report to end of January. By January, SAC changed the report date to end of February and there is no further news since then. After pressed by the prosecutor's office, SAC has now undertaken to delver a report by the end of April. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> The destination of SQ-006 was Los Angeles and some passengers are Americans. Hence, some family members of passengers who died in the crash have already commenced legal actions in U.S. courts for damages against Singapore Airlines and also in some cases, against Taiwan's Civil Aeronautics Administration. </seg>
<seg id=8> The claims by family members are equivalent to an accusation of negligence on the part of Taiwan's Civil Aeronautics Administration. Hence, the conclusion of the investigation by Taoyuan prosecutor's office becomes important. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Associated Press, Melbourne and Florida -- An asteroid, large enough to flatten an average city, brushed past the Earth within a short range of 463,000 kilometers, but was not discovered in time. It was four days after the close shave could astronomers tell about it. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> This asteroid, about 50 meters in diameter, was flying from the direction of the sun, thus astronomers could hardly detect it. </seg>
<seg id=4> The asteroid brushed past the Earth on March 8, but was not detected until March 12 when the asteroid was gone. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> Williams of the International Astronomical Union's Minor Planet Center in Cambridge, Massachusetts, has helped in determining the astronomical position of this asteroid. </seg>
<seg id=6> From the astronomical point of view, this asteroid was very close to the Earth because the moon is only 402,000 kilometers away from the Earth. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Williams on Wednesday spoke to 'Florida Today', "The key is to detect asteroids before they are flying from the direction of the sun." </seg>
<seg id=8> Thus, astronomers can determine an asteroid's orbit sooner, predicting whether it will hit the Earth or not. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> Associated Press, Beijing -- The Beijing No. 1 People's Intermediate Court yesterday sentenced Chinese-American engineer Fang Fuming to 5 years imprisonment. Fang was convicted for illegally obtaining state secrets and paying bribes on behalf of a company. </seg>
<seg id=3> This case has brought about US protests. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> A US embassy spokesman said that Fang Fuming would be deported after serving the sentence. </seg>
<seg id=5> The prison term would be adjusted to reflect the time he has been detained. </seg>
<seg id=6> The US embassy has sent a diplomat to attend the trial. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=7> Fang Fuming's lawyer said that his client has already been detained for 2 years, but China said not that long. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> Xinhua News Agency confirmed the sentence. </seg>
<seg id=9> The agency said that Fang Fuming obtained 35 documents containing state secrets from 1995 to 1999. Fang gave Chinese state workers USD245,000 (about 450,000 Singapore dollars in current value) in bribes so as to assist foreign investors in bidding for Chinese power projects. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> Fang Fuming was an electrical engineering consultant for foreign companies in China and also elsewhere in Asia. </seg>
<seg id=11> Fang Fuming's lawyer Cohen said that Fang Fuming denied paying bribes, claiming himself being the victim of the corrupted Chinese power officials. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=12> Fang Fuming used to be an official in China's electrical authority until he became a US citizen in 1994. </seg>

<seg id=2> Xinhua News Agency report of April 22 from Jerusalem (by staff reporter Zhong Cuihua) - The Foreign Journalist Association at Israel (FJAI) issued a statement on the 22nd, requesting the Israeli army to immediately return at least 17 press cards of foreign journalists which were confiscated in the city of Bethlehem in West Bank. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> The statement said an Israeli army officer confiscated press cards of foreign journalists and Palestinians working for foreign press the same day about 400 metres off the Church of the Nativity on the ground that it is a military forbidden zone, without producing any document as evidence. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> The statement pointed out that the Israeli army's confiscation of press cards was intended to restrict coverage of confrontation at the Church of the Nativity between the Israeli troops and Palestinian militants rather than for the sake of journalists' safety, and was in violation of the promise made by Israel's army last week to FJAI. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> Israeli troops invading Bethlehem sieged some 200 Palestinian militants in the Church of the Nativity on April 2 and the two sides have entered into confrontation ever since. </seg>

<p>
<seg id=2> (AFP report from Beijing) - China's state media said a severe sandstorm hit Beijing again yesterday. </seg>
<seg id=3> Although the government has invested huge funds improving Beijing's environment and trying to keep desert off Beijing, it is still a major problem faced by the city where the 2008 Olympics is to be held. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> China's State Bureau of Meteorology forecasted that the first sandstorm this year hit Beijing last Friday and a cold front from Mongolia is expected to cover Beijing with yellow sand. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> Yang Weixi, chief engineer of the Desert Control Centre of the Ministry of Forestry of China told Beijing Weekly: "I dare not say there will not be sandstorms in 2008.  </seg>
<seg id=6> What we can do is to control the human factors that contribute to sandstorms and prevent desertification of the environment." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> He said, however, natural factors like wind, drought and big deserts that are beyond the control of human beings make it impossible for China to prevent sandstorms in any short term. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=8> The Chinese government has vowed to invest 56.8 billion yuan (approximately 12.376 billion Singapore dollars) from 2002 to 2008 to prevent desertification and reduce sandstorms. </seg>
<seg id=9> Beijing alone will spend about 1 billion yuan (220 million Singapore dollars) this year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> An expert from the Chinese Academy of Forestry Science said: "Increase in government funds will change the situation for the better, but ..it will probably take dozens of years to see the effect." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=11> China's environmental experts, after making surveys early this year, warned that about one third of China's territory is desert, which was caused mainly by human's economic activities such as overgrazing. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=12> The survey found in the first 6 months of last year, there occurred 18 sandstorms in Beijing and all the sand was originating from Inner Mongolia, where 60 percent of the land is desert. </seg>

<seg id=2> (Report from Taipei) - The investigation report of the Flight Safety Committee of Taiwan (FSCT) has been delayed over and again one and a half years after the Singapore Airlines crash, bringing the investigation of the local prosecution of TaoYuan County to a standstill. The local prosecution suspects untold reasons as FSCT promised to submit the report in April. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> At 11:18 on October 31, 2000, an aircraft of Singapore Airlines on an SQ-006 flight from Chiang Kai-shek Airport to Los Angels of US mistakenly ran into the 05 runway when taking off, rammed into two dredges and exploded, leaving 83 passengers dead and up to 100 wounded. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> China Times reported yesterday that the Local Prosecution of TaoYuan County responsible for investigation of the criminal liabilities have fought a few rounds for the investigating power. </seg>
<seg id=5> Since the air crash took place, Chief Prosecutor of the Local Prosecution of TaoYuan County, Wang Tien-Shen has been promoted to the position of Chief Prosecutor of TaiChung City and he was succeeded by Chen Shiu-Huang, while the acting prosecutor Huang Mo-Shen was also transferred to the Prosecution of Taipei and the case was passed on to Jiang Yun-Jen. </seg>
<seg id=6> FSCT once claimed the investigation report would be finalized by the end of last year, but delayed it until the end of January before putting it off again to February. With the actual date still unknown, the FSCT, urged by the Prosecution, has promised to submit the report in April. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> As the destination of the SQ-006 flight is Los Angels, relatives of some victims have brought actions at US courts for huge civil claims against the Singapore Airlines as well as the Aviation Bureau of Taiwan. </seg>
<seg id=8> The claims of the victims' relatives are based on accusation of negligence by the Aviation Tower and administrators in Taiwan. Therefore, the conclusion of the Local Prosecution of TaoYuan Country will be of exceptional concern.  </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> Fang Fuming is a consultant on electricity projects for a foreign company in China and other Asian areas. </seg>
<seg id=11> Fang Fuming's lawyer Kohn said that Fang Fuming denied bribery and said he was a victim of corrupted Chinese officials in the electricity administration. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=12> Fang Fuming was an official in China's electricity administration and became a US citizen in 1994. </seg>

<seg id=1> China Cancels Naval fleet visit to US and Refuses to Confirm Hu Jingtao's Scheduled Visit </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id=2> (Summary of reports from Beijing) - The warming relations between US and China brought about by US President Bush's visit to China has turned cold rapidly as China confirmed yesterday to have cancelled its naval fleet's visit to the US ports this year, and refused to confirm whether Vice-President Hu Jingtao will visit the US as scheduled. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=3> Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue said when answering questions at the regular press conference, "As far as I know, China's naval fleet is being prepared for a planned visit, which does not include US ports." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=4> When asked twice by a journalist whether Hu Jingtao's visit to the US has been affected and when requested to clarify whether the earlier reply could be understood as that Hu Jingtao's visit to the US in April will go on as scheduled, Zhang made no comments or confirmation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=5> Zhang Qiyue just repeated accusations that the US "has done a series of things in violation of the three joint Communiques between China and the US" within only one month following Bush's visit to China, and requested that the US "stop interfering in China's internal affairs with the Taiwan issue." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=6> In another development, in Washington on Wednesday the US paid no attention to China's warning that "cold wind" is blowing on Sino-US relations and insisted that it is not improper to permit Taiwan's Defence Minister to attend the "US-Taiwan Defence Summit" held in Florida. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=7> Beijing has repeatedly hit out at the US issuing visa to Taiwanese Defence Minister Tang Yiau-ming earlier this month to attend the meeting hosted by the US arms dealers. </seg>
<seg id=8> Tang Yiau-ming also met with two senior officials of the US government at that time. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=9> Richard Boucher, Spokesman for the US State Department was questioned by journalists at the regular press conference on China's protest of the issue, but he apparently tried to avoid squabble with China. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=10> He said, "Our stance is known to everyone after the meeting." </seg>
<seg id=11> "If you would ask me about the issue everyday, I would like to explain it everyday. If China would ask about the issue everyday, we would explain it everyday." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=12> He said,"Our stance has not changed. These are normal contacts between us and the Taiwanese and we will continue to do so." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id=13> Zhang Qiyue yesterday also confirmed the Russian press reports that Chinese President Jiang Zemin had a phone call with Russian President Putin at the request of the latter, and the two sides exchanged views on cooperation between China and Russia based on mutual benefit." </seg>
<seg id=14> Both sides believed that the cooperation between China and Russia on mutual benefit is in the interest of both the countries and their people. </seg>
